              <ol>
                  <li>Explain 3 main differences between web1, web2, web3?
                       <ul>
                          <li><b>Usage: </b>Web1 was mainly used in research and academy, in Web2 Anyone with an internet connection could publish their thoughts, ideas, media, and more which gave access to wide spread of users. in Web3 more interfaces like voice interfaces, VR/AR, and brain-computer interfaces provide alternative ways which gave access even to disabled people</li>
                          <li><b>Fuctionality: </b>Web1 pages provided very basic functionality that contained only text and images, where Web2 pages had more interactive contenent which gave users the abillity to publish their thoughts, ideas, media, and share that information with each other. in Web3 was the rise of AI and machine learning which enables highly personalized experiences to each user. Almost everything can be costomized anf fit to the individual.</li>
                          <li><b>E-Commrance: </b>Web1 had only a few book stores ,electronics and music. and people were hesitant to buy online. In Web2 the shift to a more participatory web allowed more business opportunities in education ,marketing and more various fields, many startup companies based on the Web2 technologies rose because of that. in web3 thanks to the AI and machine learning things like the sharing economy, freelancing marketplaces, and subscription services emerge allowing even more buisiness opportunities.</li>
                      </ul>
                  
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Explain the differences you wrote in Q1 who it will look like in each web version using use case
                      <br>
                      <b>Use case "chating with your friend"</b> 
                      <ul>
                          <li><b>Web1: </b>in Web1 that functionality didnt exist because the pages wern't interactive if it did had only text and may be a profile pic. i wouldn't recommend a business model based on chating in this version.</li>
                          <li><b>Web2: </b>in this version there is more interactive functionalities and the basic chat was available. many companies started to use this function such as ICQ, facebook and many more.</li>
                          <li><b>web3: </b>here the AI made chat more convinient allowed auto correct and complete to make the chat easier, also more features such as voice masseges gave more people the abillity to use the chat. This gave room for more buisinesses and startup to form.</li>
                      </ul>
                  </li>
              </ol>
