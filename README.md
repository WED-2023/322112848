This site is about a fictional character "Rick Santchez" from Rick and Morty TV series
Every thing was build as asked in the assaingment, the only thing i did different is the "contact me" form 
clicking on "contact me" will send you to the footer, while clicking the anchor at the footer will open a new window 
where you can add you name, email and meggase and send it with your email using the "mailto" option.
I hope the site will be to your satisfaction.
